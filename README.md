Image Steganography refers to the technique of hiding information within digital images in such a way that it remains undetectable to the human eye. In the context of Credaphy, this method can be utilized to securely embed important academic data (such as certification details, credit information, or student credentials) into an image file.

Use Case in Credaphy
Credaphy could implement image steganography to securely encode and hide certification data within official student certificates, ensuring that the information is protected from tampering. This hidden data can only be decoded by authorized systems or individuals with the appropriate tools, enhancing the security and authenticity of academic records.

How it Works
Data Embedding: Academic data (such as student ID, course credits, etc.) is embedded within the pixels of an image, typically using the least significant bit (LSB) technique, where small modifications to the image's pixel values conceal the information without visibly altering the image.

Data Extraction: Authorized users or systems can extract and decode the hidden information using specialized algorithms, ensuring that only those with permission can access the sensitive data.

Benefits in Credaphy
Data Security: Sensitive student information can be securely hidden in certificate images, reducing the risk of forgery or tampering.
Authentication: Enables verification of certificate authenticity by decoding embedded data to match stored records.
Invisibility: The embedded information is concealed within the image, leaving no visual trace, making the method highly discreet.
By integrating image steganography into Credaphy, the platform adds an extra layer of security to the management and dissemination of academic credits and certifications.
